# Giphy

- We are working with APIs this week, so this is a webpage that will connect to the Giphy API and show 10 Gifs based on the character chosen.

- If you click a button it will show 10 gifs based on the TV Character pressed.

- Type a new Character in the form and it will create a new button for you to press.

- You can click on each Giphy to start the animation and click again to stop the animation.
